## Dashboard

The dashboard presents two gauges to the left of the speedometer. The left-most gauge
denotes the battery level, while the right-most denotes the gas level. The gas gauge
lowers as expected, but the battery gauge fills up and depletes in a seemingly randomized
way. After breaking to a complete stop, you are shown a "break score" which without research is
confusing and seems to mean nothing. The lack of clarity reduces **usability** and **satisfaction**.
The displays are mostly **efficient** at providing at-a-glance data during vehicle operation,
but certain symbols and gauges are misleading or confusing. In order to fully understand
what each piece means, a user is required to check the owner's manual or search the internet.
Many symbols are not initially **learnable** because of the vagueness of their representations. What does
a green outline of a car mean? Why are there arrows going in both directions? 

### Efficency Leaves

The efficency leaves display acts as a visual cue which shows an increaing amout of leaves as "efficency" improves.
What is not clear is whether this efficency is for the battery, gas, a combination, or something else entirely. 
By being so vague, ironically the Efficency Leaves feature is **inefficient** at displaying clear information.



## Console

The center console has a large screen to display media, but the available options take up 25% of
the screen real estate, which when unused, reduces the visibility of your focus. To connect
a bluetooth device, several steps are required which reduces a user's ability to
quickly and safely add a new device. Arguably, the user should not be driving while connecting
a bluetooth device, but it is still possible (through my own careful research) and
creates a large distraction from the road. This reduces the **safety** of the product
without adding any benefit. It is understood that a passenger may be using the console instead,
but that does not eliminate all dangerous situations. The two rectangle "source" and "sound" buttons 
are raised and prominent, **signaling** to the user that they are important and useful, however most 
of the interactions are done directly with the touch screen, and the two buttons are rarely used.
